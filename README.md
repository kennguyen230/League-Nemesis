# League Nemesis

A League of Legends website to show you who your League Nemesis is!

A player's League Nemesis is the champion they have the worst loss rate to while taking into account frequency of encounters. Users will be able to sort by lane (eg. top, jungle, mid, overall, etc), game type (eg. norms vs ranked), and season.

You can test the website using my summoner name and tag: Off Season#NA1.
