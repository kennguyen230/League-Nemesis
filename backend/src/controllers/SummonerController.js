/*
    @brief Purpose of this file is to grab summonerName from frontend then pass that forward
    to grab user data from DB and Riot API. File should ultimately gather necessary maps to return
    to the frontend for display

    NOTE: Consider the pros and cons of maintaining the raw maps instead of the lossRateMap
    & totalLossesMap

    If it is a returning user: 
        1. Grab matches & lastGameTimestamp from DB
        2. Use lastGameTimestamp as a parameter and query for latest games from Riot/Shieldbow
        3. Populate a map with the latest games 
        4. Merge latestGames map with preexisting maps
        5. Return maps to frontend

    If it is a new user:
        1. Query for as many games as possible from Riot/Shieldbow
        2. Create lossRateMap and totalLossesMap
        3. Possibly continue querying for more games in the background & populate
            the database with the new games.
